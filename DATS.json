	"description": "This dataset includes raw wide-field GCaMP image sequences and time stamps of spike trains simultaneously recorded with GCaMP imaging and processed GCaMP images and spike trains: df/f0 with 0.1-10 band pass filter and spike train binned in one frame time. Most experiments were performed toward the end of the mouse light cycle. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (0.5–1.0%) or urethane during data collection. Images of the cortical surface were recorded through a pair of front-to-front video lenses coupled to a CCD camera. Calcium indicators were excited with blue-light-emitting diodes (470 nm) with bandpass filters (467–499 nm). Emission fluorescence was filtered using a 510–550 nm bandpass filter. For in vivo single unit recording, the electrode was inserted into the right hemisphere with a 45 degree angle from the lateral surface of the cortex to avoid contact with the region where wide-field imaging was performed. The electrode was first held in the cortex for cortical recordings and then advanced into the sub-cortical areas.",
